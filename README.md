# Data Structures
Data structures implemented in C programming languages includes: Linked List, Double Linked List, normal Queue, circular Queue, Stack using arrays, and Stack using Linked List.

When running any of the files in your IDE, a menu with various options will appear (e.g. 1) Push to the stack.). After each option chosen, the data structure, Stack, Queue, or Linked List, will be printed to illustrate the action performed. You can keep choosing different options from the menu until you choose 0 to exit. That way it is much easier to test all the functionalities of each data structure without having to hit the run button each time.
